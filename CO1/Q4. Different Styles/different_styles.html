    <h2>Earth</h2>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
        About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, 
        mostly by oceans but also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. 
        Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic 
        plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a 
        solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
        According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, 
        Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in 
        the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, 
        later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. 
        Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. 
        In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally 
        punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Almost 8 billion humans 
        live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans increasingly impact Earth's hydrology,
         atmospheric processes and other life.
        Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical 
        regions than polar regions, and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases 
        also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not only determined 
        by latitude, but also by elevation, and by proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. Extreme weather, 
        such as tropical cyclones and heat waves, occurs in most areas and has a large impact on life.
        Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. 
        Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital 
        plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes 
        Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and 
        the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets. </p>
    <h2>Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, 
        being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war 
        and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[18] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.
        The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as 
        the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of 
        Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, 
        and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin 
        in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, 
        Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.
        Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit Mars; 
        launched by NASA on 28 November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15 July 1965. Mariner 4 detected 
        the weak Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured the first images of another planet from deep space.
        The Soviet Mars 3 mission included a lander, which achieved a soft landing in December 1971; however, 
        contact was lost seconds after touchdown.On 20 July 1976, Viking 1 performed the first successful landing on 
        the Martian surface.[25] On 4 July 1997, the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft landed on Mars and on 5 July released its rover, 
        Sojourner, the first robotic rover to operate on Mars.[26] The Mars Express orbiter, the first European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft to
        visit Mars, arrived in orbit on 25 December 2003.[27] In January 2004, the Mars Exploration Rovers, named Spirit and Opportunity, both landed on Mars. Spirit operated until 22 March 2010 and Opportunity lasted until 10 June 2018.[28] On 24 September 2014, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) became the fourth space agency to visit Mars when its maiden interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft, arrived in orbit.[29] The United Arab Emirates became the fifth to successfully undertake a mission to Mars, having inserted an orbiter in to the Martian atmosphere on 9 February 2021.[30]
        There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life. 
        Astrobiology missions are planned, including the Perseverance and Rosalind Franklin rovers.
        Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the 
        atmospheric pressure on Earth, except at the lowest elevations for short periods. The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water.
        The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient 
        to cover the planetary surface to a depth of 11 metres (36 ft).[40] In November 2016, NASA 
        reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water 
        detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior.
        Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude 
        reaches âˆ’2.94, which is surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.[12] Optical ground-based telescopes are typically 
        limited to resolving features about 300 kilometres (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.[</p>
